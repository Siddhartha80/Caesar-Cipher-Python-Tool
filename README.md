The Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages using a substitution method. It was used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC to send secret messages to his allies. 
The Caesar cipher works by shifting the letters in the message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”. For example, if the key is 3, the letter A is substituted by the letter D, the letter B is replaced by the letter E, and so on.
The Caesar cipher is also called a shift cipher or additive cipher. It is based on a mono-alphabetic cipher, which means that the replacement remains the same throughout the message. 
To decrypt a Caesar cipher, the receiver reverses the shift. Arab mathematician Al-Kindi broke the Caesar cipher using frequency analysis, which exploits patterns in letter frequencies.
